# Cartoon-Pok-mon-feature-prediction-Analysis

Introduction:

We have a comprehensive Pokémon dataset containing information pertaining to the myriad species featured within the animated television series. This dataset has a wealth of details, encompassing each Pokémon's nomenclature, classification, defensive and offensive mechanisms, hue, stature, mass, and an array of supplementary categories.

Objective:

Aim to apply data visualization, mining algorithms, and check the model with best accuracy- the one that able to predict the 'Feature' of the pokemon.
