# Cartoon-Pok-mon-feature-prediction-Analysis

Introduction:

We have a comprehensive Pokémon dataset containing information pertaining to the myriad species featured within the animated television series. This dataset has a wealth of details, encompassing each Pokémon's nomenclature, classification, defensive and offensive mechanisms, hue, stature, mass, and an array of supplementary categories. When encountering a noew Pokémon, how can we accurately forecast the Feature it pertains to, along with its associated attributes?

Objective:

To apply data visualization, mining algorithms, and check the model with best accuracy- the one that is able to predict the 'Feature' of the pokemon.

Procedure:

- Dataset.jpg illustrates all column values and types. The dataset can be found in Kaggle, if you intent to try the same project.
- Pokemon.ipynb file has all the required code for summarizing the objective.
- Without pre-processing.jpg exhibits all the model accuracy before applying various techniques on the data.
